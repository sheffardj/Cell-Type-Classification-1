  3) imkl/11.3.4.258 => imkl/2020.1.217

Lmod has detected the following error: Cannot load module "nixpkgs/16.09"
because these module(s) are loaded:
   StdEnv/2020

While processing the following module(s):
    Module fullname  Module Filename
    ---------------  ---------------
    nixpkgs/16.09    /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/custom/modules/nixpkgs/16.09.lua


Lmod is automatically replacing "intel/2020.1.217" with "gcc/9.3.0".


Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
