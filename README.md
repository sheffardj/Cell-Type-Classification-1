# Cell-Type-Classification-1
For Univeristy of Victoria Course: Stat 454/556 | Machine Learning (MIDTERM PROJECT)

Auto-annotation of RNA-sequence data (18000+ features, 1 binary predictor and existing labels) into 5 cell types with feature reduction, using 100 ten-fold cross-validations over 5 models: Lasso, Elastic Net, and Ridge Regression, as well as a tuned Classification Tree and Linear Discriminant Analysis. 

Models compared with Wilcox test, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores all ploted. I wrote all the R code and the shell script to upload the project to Compute Canada, my partner helped with theory, troubleshooting, and the project presentation.
